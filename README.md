# Playwright Visual Scenes Benchmark

This project contains Playwright end-to-end tests for benchmarking visual scene generation in a web application.

## Project Structure

- `tests-examples/benchmark.spec.js`: Main test file for running scene benchmarks using prompts.
- `pictures/`: Screenshots generated by the tests for each scene.
- `playwright.config.js`: Playwright configuration file.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Set environment variables**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following content:

   ```env
   TEST_URL=<your_visualization_app_url>
   ```

   Replace `<your_visualization_app_url>` with the URL of the app to test.

## Running Tests

To run the benchmark tests and generate screenshots:

```sh
pnpm test
```

Screenshots will be saved in the `pictures/` directory.

## Notes

- The tests wait for a specific message (`Done! Json returned!`) to ensure the scene is ready before taking a screenshot.
- You can adjust the prompts in `tests-examples/prompts.json` to benchmark different scenes.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- pnpm
- Playwright
